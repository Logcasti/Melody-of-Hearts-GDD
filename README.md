Created by Logan Castillero  
Copyright © 2025. All rights reserved.

Melody of Hearts is a genre-based RPG where music defines the world, the weapons, and the emotional journey. Players follow Lucy, a young musician navigating anxiety and conflict across regions shaped by musical styles — from the sorrowful blues of Big Blues to the rebellious chaos of Rock.
